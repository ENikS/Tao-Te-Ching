THE NATURE OF THE TAO

  

The Tao-Path is not the All-Tao.

The Name is not the Thing named.

  

Unmanifested, it is the Secret Father of

Heaven and Earth

manifested, it is their Mother.

  

To understand this Mystery, one must be fulfilling one's will,

and if one is not thus free, one will but gain a smattering of it.

  

The Tao is one, and the Teh but a phase thereof. 
     The abyss of this Mystery is the Portal of Serpent-Wonder.

  

The Tao

  

The Teh, The Tao,

source of the Mother source of the Father

  

Heaven - Ch'ien

Fire Water - Tui

Sun

Air - Sun Earth - Ken

Moon - K'an

Earth

K'un

THE ENERGY - SOURCE OF THE SELF

  

All men know that beauty and ugliness are correlatives, as are skill and

clumsiness; one implies and suggests the other.

  

So also existence and non-existence pose the one the other;

so also is it with ease and difficulty, length and shortness; height and

lowness. Also Music exists through harmony of opposites;

time and space depend upon contraposition.

  

By the use of this method, the sage can fulfil his will without action,

and utter his word without speech.

  

All things arise without diffidence; they grow, and none interferes; they

change according to their natural order, without lust of result. The

work is accomplished; yet continueth in its orbit, without goal. This

work is done unconsciously; this is why its energy is indefatigable.

  

3

QUIETING FOLK

  

To reward merit is to stir up emulation; to prize rarities is to

encourage robbery; to display desirable things is to excite the disorder

of covetousness.

  

Therefore, the sage governeth men by keeping their minds and their bodies

at rest, contenting the one by emptiness, the other by fullness. He

satisfieth their desires, thus fulfilling their wills, and making them

frictionless; and he maketh them strong in body, to a similar end.

  

He delivereth them from the restlessness of knowledge and the cravings of

discontent. As to those who have knowledge already, he teacheth them the

way of non-action. This being assured, there is no disorder in the

world.

  

4

THE SPRING WITHOUT SOURCE

  

The Tao resembleth the emptiness of Space; to employ it, we must avoid

creating ganglia. Oh Tao, how vast art Thou, the Abyss of Abysses, thou

Holy and Secret Father of all Fatherhoods of Things!

  

Let us make our sharpness blunt; let us loosen our complexes; let us

tone down our brightness to the general obscurity. Oh Tao, how still art

thou, how pure, continuous One beyond Heaven!

  

This Tao hath no Father; it is beyond all other conceptions, higher than

the highest.

  

5

THE FORMULA OF THE VACUUM

  

Heaven and earth proceed without motive, but casually in their order of

nature, dealing with all things carelessly, like used talismans. So also

the sages deal with their people, not exercising benevolence, but

allowing the nature of all to move without friction.

  

The Space between heaven and earth is their breathing apparatus:

Exhalation is not exhaustion, but the complement of Inhalation, and this

equally of that. Speech exhausteth; guard thyself, therefore, maintaining

the perfect freedom of thy nature.

  

6

THE PERFECTING OF FORM

  

The Teh is the immortal enemy of the Tao, its feminine aspect. Heaven

and Earth issued from her Gate; this Gate is the Root of their World-

Sycamore. Its operation is of pure Joy and Love, and faileth never.

  

7

THE CONCEALMENT OF THE LIGHT

  

Heaven and Earth are mighty in continuance, because their work is

delivered from the lust of result.

  

Thus also the sage, seeking not any goal, attaineth all things; he doth

not interfere in the affairs of his body, and so that body acteth without

friction. It is because he meddleth not with personal aims that these

come to pass with simplicity.

  

8

THE NATURE OF PEACE

  

Admire thou the High Way of Water! Is not Water the soul of the life of

things, whereby they change? Yet it seeketh its level, and abideth

content in obscurity. So also it resembleth the Tao, in this Way

thereof!

  

The virtue of a house is to be well-placed; of the mind, to be at easein

silence as of Space; of societies, to be well-disposed; of governments,

to maintain quietude; of work, to be skillfully performed; and of all

motion, to be made at the right time.

  

Also it is the virtue of a man to abide in his place without discontent;

thus offendeth he no man.

  

9

THE WAY OF RETICENCE

  

Fill not a vessel, lest it spill in carrying. Meddle not with a

sharpened point by feeling it constantly, or it will soon become

blunted.

  

Gold and jade endanger the house of their possessor. Wealth and honors

lead to arrogance and envy, and bring ruin. Is thy way famous and thy

name becoming distinguished? Withdraw, thy work once done, into

obscurity; this is the way of Heaven.

  

10

THINGS ATTAINABLE

  

When soul and body are in the bond of love, they can be kept together.

By concentration on the breath it is brought to perfect elasticity, and one

becomes as a babe. By purifying oneself from Samadhi one becomes whole

  

In his dealing with individuals and with society, let him move without

lust of result. In the management of his breath, let him be like the

mother-bird. Let his intelligence comprehend every quarter; but let his

knowledge cease.

  

Here is the Mystery of Virtue. It createth all and nourisheth all; yet

it doth not adhere to them; it operateth all, but knoweth not of it, nor

proclaimeth it; it directeth all, but without conscious control.

  

11

THE VALUE OF THE UNEXPRESSED

  

The thirty spokes join in their nave, that is one; yet the wheel

dependeth for use upon the hollow place for the axle. Clay is shapen to

make vessels; but the contained space is what is useful. Matter is

therefore of use only to mark the limits of the space which is the thing

of real value.

  

12

THE WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EXTERNAL

  

The five colors film over Sight; The five sounds make Hearing dull; The

five flavours conceal Taste; occupation with motion and action bedevil

Mind; even so the esteem of rare things begetteth covetousness and

disorder.

  

The wise man seeketh therefore to content the actual needs of the

people; not to excite them by the sight of luxuries. He banneth these,

and concentrateth on those.

  

13

THE CONTEMPT FOR CIRCUMSTANCE

  

Favor and disgrace are equally to be shunned; honour and calamity to be

alike regarded as adhering to the personality.

  

What is this which is written concerning favour and disgrace? Disgrace

is the fall from favour. He then that hath favour hath fear, and its

loss begetteth fear yet greater of a further fall. What is this which is

written concerning honour and calamity? It is this attachment to the

body which maketh calamity possible; for were one bodiless, what evil

could befall him?

  

Therefore let him that regardeth himself rightly administer also a

kingdom; and let him govern it who loveth it as another man loveth

himself.

  

14

THE SHEWING-FORTH OF THE MYSTERY

  

We look at it, and see it not; though it is Omnipresent; and we name it

We listen for it, and hear it not, though it is

We feel for it, and touch it not,

These three Virtues

hath it, yet we cannot describe it as consisting of them; but, mingling them

aright, we apprehend the One.

  

It moveth all

It is the Form

of That which is beyond Form; it is the Image of the Invisible; it is

Change, and Without Limit.

  

We confront it, and see not its Face; we pursue it, and its Back is

but apply the Tao as in old Time to the work of the

present; know it as it was known in the Beginning; follow fervently the

Thread of the Tao.

  

15

THE APPEARANCE OF THE TRUE NATURE

  

The adepts of past ages were subtle and keen to apprehend this Mystery,

Since then they were not

known, let me declare their nature.

  

To all seeming, they were fearful as men that cross a torrent in winter

flood; they were hesitating like a man in apprehension of them thatare

about him; they were full of awe like a guest in a great house; theywere

ready to disappear like ice in thaw; they were unassuming like unworked

wood; they were empty as a valley; and dull as the waters of a marsh.

  

Who can

Let motion continue equably, and it will itself be peace.

  

The adepts of the Tao, conserving its way, seek not to be actively self-

By their emptiness of Self they have no need to show

their youth and perfection; to appear old and imperfect is their

privilege.

  

16

THE WITHDRAWAL TO THE ROOT

  

Emptiness must be perfect, and Silence made absolute with tireless

All things pass through the period of action; then they return

They grow, bud, blossom and fruit; then they return to the

This return to the root is this state which we name Silence ;and

this Silence is Witness of their Fulfilment.

  

To know it is the part of intelligence;

To know it

bringeth understanding and peace; and these lead to the identification of

This identification maketh man a king; and

That godhood beareth fruit in the

Then the man, the Tao permeating him, endureth; and

his bodily principles are in harmony, proof against decay, until the

hour of his Change.

  

17

THE PURITY OF THE CURRENT

  

In the Age of Gold, the people were not conscious of their rulers; in the

Age of Silver, they loved them, with songs; in the Age of Brass, they

As the rulers

lost confidence, so also did the people lose confidence in them.

  

How hesitating did they seem, the Lords of the Age of Gold, speaking with

Thus they accomplished

all things with success; and the people deemed their well-being to be the

natural course of events.

  

18

THE DECAY OF MANNERS

  

When men abandoned the Way of the Tao, benevolence and justice became

Then also was need of wisdom and cunning, and all fell into

When harmony ceased to prevail in the six spheres it was needful

When the kingdoms and races became

confused, loyal ministers had to appear.

  

19

RETURNING TO THE PURITY OF THE CURRENT

  

If we forgot our statesmanship and our wisdom, it would be an hundred

If we forgot our benevolence and our

If we

forget our machines and our business, there would be no knavery.

  

These new methods despised the olden Way, inventing fine names to

But simplicity in the doing of the will of

every man would put an end to vain ambitions and desires.

  

20

THE WITHDRAWAL FROM THE COMMON WAY

  

The smallest difference in words,

such as 'yes' and 'yea', can make endless controversy for the

Fearful indeed is death, since all men fear it; but the abyss of

questionings, shoreless and bottomless, is worse!

  

Consider the profane man, how he preeneth, as if at feast, or gazing upon

But as for me, I am as one who yawneth, without any

I appear sad

The profane man hath his need filled,

My mind is as

The profane man looketh

They seem

I seem to be

The

profane have each one his definite course of action; I alone appear

Yea, thus I

differ from all other men: but my jewel is the All-Mother!

  

21

THE INFINITE WOMB

  

It is

It is beyond Sense ,yet

It is beyond Sense, yet all

It is beyond Sense, yet all Being is

This Being excites Perception, and the Word thereof.

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, its Name

operateth continuously, causing all to flow in the cycle of Change, which

By my comprehension of the Tao.

  

22

THE GUERDON OF MODESTY

  

The curve becometh straight; the void

He who desireth little

accomplisheth his Will with ease; who desireth many things becometh

distracted.

  

Therefore, the sage concentrateth upon one Will, and it is as a light to

Hiding himself, he shineth; withdrawing himself, he

attracteth notice; humbling himself, he is exalted; dissatisfied with

Because he striveth not,

no man may contend against him.

  

That is no idle saw of the men of old; 'The part becometh the whole';it

is the Canon of Perfection.

  

23

THE VOID OF NAUGHT

  

To keep silence is the mark of one who is acting in full accordance with

A fierce wind soon falleth; a storm-shower doth not last all

Yet Heaven and Earth cause these; and if they fail to make violence

continue, how much less can man abide in spasm of passion!

  

With him that devoteth him to Tao, the devotees of Tao are in accord; so

also are the devotees of Teh, yea, even they who fail in seeking those are in

accord.

  

So then his brothers in the Tao are joyful, attaining it; and his

brothers in the Teh are joyful, attaining it; and they who fail in

But if he himself realize not

the Tao with calm of confidence, then they also appear lacking in

confidence.

  

24

EVIL MANNERS

  

He who standeth a-tiptoe standeth not firm; he who maketh rigid his legs

He who preeneth himself shineth not; he who talketh

positively is vulgar; he who boastheth is refused acceptance; he whois

Such attitudes, to him that

hath the view given by understanding the Tao, seem like garbage or like

They then who follow the Way do not admit them.

  

25

IMAGES OF THE MYSTERY

  

Without Limit and Perfect, there is a Becoming, beyond Heaven and Earth.

It hath nor motion nor Form; it is alone, it changeth not; it extendeth

It is like the All-Mother.

  

Moreover, I exert myself,

and call it Vastness.

  

Afar, it draweth

Vast is this Tao; Heaven also is Vast; Earth is vast; and the Holy

In the Universe are Four Vastnesses, and of these is

the Holy King.

  

Man followeth the formula of Earth; Earth followeth that of Heaven ,and

The formula of the Tao is its own Nature.

  

26

THE NATURE OF MASS

  

Mass is the fulcrum of mobility; stillness is the father of motion.

  

Therefore the sage King, though he travel afar, remaineth near his

Though opportunity tempt him, he remaineth quietly in proper

Should the master of an host of chariots bear

If he attack without support, he loseth his base;

if he become a raider, he forfeiteth his throne.

  

27

SKILL IN THE METHOD

  

The experienced traveler concealeth his tracks; the clever speaker giveth

no chance to the critic; the skilled mathematician useth no abacus; the

ingenious safesmith baffleth the burglar without the use of bolts, and

So also the sage, skilled in

man-emancipation-craft, useth all men; understanding the value of everything,

This is called the Occult Regimen.

  

The adept is then master to the zelator, and the zelator assisteth and

Yet unless these relations were manifest, even the

This

is called the Crown of Mystery.

  

28

THE RETURN TO SIMPLICITY

  

Balance thy male strength with thy female weakness and thou shalt attract

all things, as the ocean absorbeth all rivers; for thou shalt formulate

Knowing the light,

Clothed in

this Child-excellence eternal, thou hast attained the Return of the First

Knowing splendour of Fame, cling to Obloquy and Infamy; then shalt

thou remain as in the Valley to which flow all waters, the lodestone to

Yea, they shall hail in thee this Excellence, eternal,

simple and perfect, of the Child.

  

So the sage

King formulateth his Wholeness in divers Offices; and his Law is without

violence or constraint.

  

29

REFRAINING FROM ACTION

  

A

He who

graspeth it, destroyeth it; he who gaineth it, loseth it.

  

The wheel of nature revolveth constantly; the last becometh first, and

the first last; hot things grow cold, and cold things hot; weakness

Hence the wise man

avoideth effort, desire and sloth.

  

30

A WARNING AGAINST WAR

  

If a king summon to his aid a Master of the Tao, let Him not advise

Such action certainly bringeth the corresponding

reaction.

  

Bad harvests follow great hosts.

  

He does not

He

striketh according to strict law of necessity, not from desire of victory

  

This is discord with the

Tao; and what is not at one with the Tao soon cometh to an end.

  

31

COMPOSING QUARREL

  

Arms, though they be beautiful, are of ill omen, abominable to all

They who have the Tao love not their use.

  

The place of honour is on the right in wartime; so thinketh the man of

Sharp weapons are ill-omened, unworthy of such a man; he

He valueth peace and ease, desireth not

To desire victory is to desire the death of men;

and to desire that is to fail to propitiate the people.

  

The

second in command of the army leadeth the left wing, the commander-in-

chief, the right wing; it is as if the battle were a rite of mourning!

He that hath slain most men should weep for them most bitterly; so then

the place of the victor is assigned to him with philosophical propriety.

  

32

THE WISDOM OF TEH

  

The All-Tao hath no name.

  

It is That Minute Point yet the whole world dare not contend

Did a lord or king gain it and guard it, all

men would obey him of their own accord.

  

Heaven and Earth combining under its spell, shed forth dew, extending

throughout all things of its own accord, without man's interference.

  

Then men can comprehend it;

when they do this, there is no more risk of wrong or ill-success.

  

As the great rivers and the oceans are to the valley streams, so is the

Tao to the whole universe.

  

33

THE DISCRIMINATION (VIVEKA) OF TEH

  

He who understandeth others understandeth Two; but he who understandeth

He who conquereth others is strong; but he

Contentment is riches; and continuous

action is Will.

  

He that adapteth himself perfectly to his environment, continueth for

long; he who dieth without dying, liveth for ever.

  

34

THE METHOD OF ATTAINMENT

  

The Tao is immanent; it extendeth to the right hand as to the left.

  

All things derive from it their being; it createth them, and all comply

It is the

ornament of all things, yet it claimeth not fief of them; there is

nothing so small that it inhabiteth not, and informeth it.

All things return without knowledge of the Cause thereof; there is

nothing so great that it inhabiteth not, and informeth it.

  

It is by not

thrusting himself forward that he winneth to his success.

  

35

THE GOOD WILL OF THE TEH

  

The whole world is drawn to him that hath the likeness of the Tao.

Men flock unto him, and suffer no ill, but gain repose, find

peace, enjoy all ease.

  

But the Word of

the Tao; though it appear harsh and insipid, unworthy to hearken or to

behold; hath his use all inexhaustible.

  

36

THE HIDING OF THE LIGHT

  

In order to draw breath, first empty the lungs; to weaken another, first

strengthen him; to overthrow another, first exalt him; to despoil

another, first load him with gifts; this is called the Occult Regimen.

  

The soft conquereth the hard; the weak pulleth down the strong.

  

The fish that leaveth ocean is lost; the method of government must be

concealed from the people.

  

37

THE RIGHT USE OF GOVERNMENT

  

The Tao proceedeth by its own nature, doing nothing; therefore there is

no doing which it comprehendeth not.

  

If kings and princes were to govern in this manner, all things would

operate aright by their own motion.

  

If this transmutation were my object, I should call it Simplicity.

Simplicity hath no name nor purpose; silently and at ease all things go

well.

  

38

CONCERNING THE TEH

  

Those who possessed perfectly the powers did not manifest them,

Those who possessed them imperfectly feared

to lose them, and so lost them.

  

The latter did, and had

need to do.

  

Those who possessed benevolence exercised it, and had need it; so also

was it with them who possessed justice.

  

Those who possessed the conventions displayed them; and when men would

not agree, they made ready to fight them.

  

Thus, when the Tao was lost, the Magic Powers appeared; then, by

successive degradations, came Benevolence, Justice, Convention.

  

Now convention is the shadow of loyalty and good will, and so the herald

Yea, even Understanding is but a Blossom of the Tao, and

foreshadoweth Stupidity.

  

So then the Tao-Man holdeth to Mass, and avoideth Motion; he is attached

He leaveth the one, and cleaveth to the

other.

  

39

THE LAW OF THE BEGINNING

  

These things have possessed the Tao from the beginning: Heaven, clear and

shining; Earth, steady and easy; Spirits, mighty in Magic;

Vehicles, overflowing with Joy; all that hath life; and the rulers of men.

All these derive their essence from the Tao.

  

Without the Tao, Heaven would dissolve Earth disrupt, Spirits become

impotent; Vehicles empty; living things would perish and rulers lose

their power.

  

The root of grandeur is humility, and the strength of exaltation inits

Thus rulers speak of themselves as 'Fatherless,' 'Virtueless,'

So

also the virtue of a Chariot is not any of the parts of a Chariot, if they be

They do not seek to appear fine like jade, but inconspicuous like

common stone.

  

40

OMITTING UTILITY

  

The Tao proceeds by correlative curves, and its might is in weakness.

  

All things arose from the Teh, and the Teh budded from the Tao.

  

41

THE IDENTITY OF THE DIFFERENTIAL

  

The best students, learning of the Tao, set to work earnestly to practice

Mediocre students now cherish it, now let it go.

Were it not thus mocked, it were unworthy

to be Tao.

  

Who

Its summit is

Its virtue,

Its fullness

Its reality is illusion.

  

Nameless and imperceptible is the Tao; but it informeth and perfecteth

all things.

  

42

THE VEILS OF THE TAO

  

The One exhaled the Two.

The Three were parents of all things.

All things pass from Obscurity to Manifestation, inspired harmoniously by

the Breath of the Void.

  

Men do not like to be fatherless, virtueless, unworthy: yet rulers

Thus increase bringeth decrease to

some, and decrease bringeth increase to others.

  

Violent men and strong die not

This fact is the foundation of my law.

  

43

THE COSMIC METHOD

  

The softest substance hunteth down the hardest; the unsubstantial

Here is the Virtue of Inertia.

  

Few are they who attain: whose speech is Silence, whose Work is Inertia.

  

44

MONITORIAL

  

What shall it profit a man if he gain fame or wealth, and lose his life?

  

If a man cling to fame or wealth, he risketh what is worth more.

  

Thus

live thou long, without alarm.

  

45

THE OVERFLOWING OF TEH

  

Despise thy masterpieces; thus renew the vigor of thy creation.

Deem thy fullness emptiness; thus shall thy fullness never be empty.

Let the straight appear crooked to thee, thy Craft clumsiness; thy Music

discord.

  

To be pure and to keep

silence, is the True Law of all that are beneath Heaven.

  

46

THE WITHDRAWAL FROM AMBITION

  

When the Tao beareth away on Earth, men put swift horses to night-carts.

When it is neglected, they breed chargers in the border marches.

  

There is no evil worse than ambition; no misery worse than discontent; no

Content of mind is peace and satisfaction

eternal.

  

47

THE VISION OF THE DISTANT

  

One need not pass his threshold to comprehend all that is under Heaven,

but

the farther a man goeth, the less he knoweth.

  

The sages acquired their knowledge without travel; they named all things

aright without beholding them; and, acting without aim, fulfilled their

Wills.

  

48

OBLIVION OVERCOMING KNOWLEDGE

  

The scholar seeketh daily increase of knowing; the sage of Tao daily

decrease of doing.

  

He decreaseth it, again and again, until he doth no act with the lust of

Having attained this Inertia all accomplisheth itself.

  

He who attracteth to himself all that is under Heaven doth so without

He who maketh effort is not able to attract it.

  

49

THE ADAPTABILITY OF THE TEH

  

The wise man hath no fixed principle; he adapteth his mind to his

environment.

  

To the good I am good, and to the evil I am good also; thus all become

To the true I am true, and to the false I am true; thus all become

true.

  

The sage appeareth hesitating to the world, because his mind is detached.

Therefore the people look and listen to him, as his children; and thus

doth he shepherd them.

  

50

THE ESTIMATION OF LIFE

  

Man cometh into life, and returneth again into death.

  

Three men in ten conserve life; three men in ten pursue death.

  

Three men also in ten desire to live, but their acts hasten their journey

Because of their efforts to

preserve life.

  

He that is wise in the economy of his life,

whereof he is warden for a season, journeyeth with no need to avoid the

tiger or the rhinoceros, and goeth uncorsleted among the warriors with no

The rhinoceros findeth in him no place vulnerable

Why is

Because there is no house of death in his whole body.

  

51

THE TEH AS THE NURSE

  

All things proceed from the Tao, and are sustained by its forth-flowing

Every one taketh form according to his nature, and is perfect,

Therefore, each and every one of them

glorify the Tao, and worship its forth-flowing Virtue.

  

This glorifying of the Tao, this worship of the Teh, is constantly

spontaneous, and not by appointment of Law.

  

Thus the Tao buddeth them out, nurtureth them, developeth them,

sustaineth them, perfecteth them, ripeneth them, upholdeth them, and

reabsorbeth them.

  

It buddeth them forth, and claimeth not lordship over them; it is

overseer of their changes, and boasteth not of his puissance; perfecteth

them, and interfereth not with their Ways; this is called the Mystery of

its Virtue.

  

52

THE WITHDRAWAL INTO THE SILENCE

  

The Tao buddeth forth all things under Heaven; it is the Mother of all.

  

He that knoweth his

Mother, and abideth in Her nature, remaineth in surety all his days.

  

With the mouth closed, and the Gates of Breath controlled, he remaineth

With the mouth open, and the Breath directed to

outward affairs, he hath no surety all his days.

  

To perceive that Minute Point is True Vision; to maintain the

Soft and Gentle is True Strength.

  

Employing harmoniously the Light Within so that it

returneth to its Origin, one guardeth even one's body from evil, and

keepeth Silence before all men.

  

53

THE WITNESS OF GREED

  

Were I discovered by men, and charged with government, my first would be

lest I should become proud.

  

The true Path is level and smooth; but men love by-paths.

  

They adorn their courts, but they neglect their fields, and leave their

They wear elaborate and embroidered robes; they gird

themselves with sharp swords; they eat and drink with luxury; they heap

All this is opposite to

the Way of Tao.

  

54

THE WITNESS OF WISDOM

  

If a man plant according to the Tao it will never be uprooted; if he thus

His sons and his son's sons, one

following another, shall honour the shrine of their ancestor.

  

The Tao, applied to oneself, strengtheneth the Body, to the

family, bringeth wealth; to the district, prosperity; to

Let it be the Law of the Kingdom, and

all men will increase in virtue.

  

Thus we observe its effect in every case, as to the person, the family,

the district, the state, and the kingdom.

  

How do I know that this is thus universal under Heaven?

By experience.

  

55

THE SPELL OF THE MYSTERY

  

He that hath the Magic powers of the Tao is like a young child.

Insects will not sting him or beasts or birds of prey attack him.

  

The young child's bones are tender and its sinews are elastic, but its

It knoweth nothing of the Union of Man and Woman, yet its

It will

cry all day long without becoming hoarse, because of the harmony of its

being.

  

He who understandeth this harmony knoweth the mystery of the Tao, and

All devices for inflaming life, and increasing the

vital Breath, by mental effort are evil and

factitious.

  

This is in discord with the Tao, and

what is not at one with the Tao soon cometh to an end.

  

56

THE EXCELLENCE OF THE MYSTERY

  

Who knoweth the Tao keepeth Silence; he who babbleth knoweth it not.

  

Who knoweth it closeth his mouth and controlleth the Gates of his Breath.

He will make his sharpness blunt; he will loosen his complexes; he will

This is called the

Secret of Harmony.

  

He cannot be insulted either by familiarity or aversion; he is immune to

ideas of gain or loss, of honour or disgrace; he is the true man,

unequalled under Heaven.

  

57

THE TRUE INFLUENCE

  

One may govern a state by restriction; weapons may be used with skill and

cunning; but one acquireth true command only by freedom, given and taken.

  

By experience that to multiply restrictive laws

in the kingdom impoverisheth the people; the use of machines causeth

The more men use skill and cunning,

the more machines there are; and the more laws there are, the more felons

there are.

  

A wise man has said this: I will refrain from doing, and the people will

act rightly of their own accord; I will love Silence, and the people will

instinctively turn to perfection; I will take no measures, and the people

will enjoy true wealth; I will restrain ambition, and the people will

attain simplicity.

ADAPTATION TO ENVIRONMENT

  

The government that exerciseth the least care serveth the people best;

that which meddleth with everybody's business worketh all manner of harm.

Sorrow and joy are bedfellows; who can divine the final result of either?

  

Yea; restriction distorteth nature, so that

For how long have men suffered

from misunderstanding of this.

  

The wise man is foursquare, and avoideth aggression; his corners do not

He moveth in a straight line and turneth not aside therefrom;

he is brilliant but doth not blind with his brightness.

WARDING THE TAO

  

.

To balance our earthly nature and cultivate our heavenly nature, tread

the Middle Path.

  

This Middle Path alone leadeth to the Timely Return to the True Nature.

This Timely Return resulteth from the constant gathering of Magic

This Control we know

to be without Limit and he who knoweth the Limitless may rule the state.

  

He is like a plant with well-

Thus it secureth long continuance of its

life.

  

60

THE DUTY OF GOVERNMENT

  

The government of a kingdom is like the cooking of fish.

  

If the kingdom be ruled according to the Tao, the spirits of our

These spirits have this The ,but

It is able to hurt men; so also is the

Wise King; but he doth not.

  

When these powers are in accord, their Good Will produceth the Teh,

endowing the people therewith.

  

61

THE MODESTY OF THE TEH

  

A state becometh powerful when it resembleth a great river, deep-seated;

to it tend all the small streams under Heaven.

  

It is as with the female, that conquereth the male by her Silence.

Silence is a form of Gravity.

  

Thus a great state attracteth small states by meeting their views, and

In the

first case this Silence gaineth supporters; in the second, favour.

  

The great state uniteth men and nurtureth them; the small state wisheth

the good will of the great, and offereth service; thus each gaineth its

But the great state must keep Silence.

  

62

THE WORKINGS OF THE TAO

  

It is the ornament of the

good, and the protection and purification of the evil.

  

Its words are the fountain of honour, and its deeds the engine of

It is present even in evil.

  

Though the Son of Heaven were enthroned with his three Dukes appointed to

serve him, and he were offered a round symbol- of-rank as great as might

fill the hands, with a team of horses to follow, this gift were not to be

matched against the Tao, which might be offered by the humblest of men.

  

Because he that

sought it might find it, and because it was the Purification from all

Therefore did all men under Heaven esteem it the most exalted of

all things.

  

63

FORETHOUGHT AT THE OUTSET

  

Act without lust of result; work without anxiety; taste without

attachment to flavour; esteem small things great and few things many;

repel violence with gentleness.

  

Do great things while they are yet small, hard things while they are yet

easy; for all things, how great or hard soever, have a beginning when

So thus the wise man accomplisheth the

greatest tasks without undertaking anything important.

  

Who undertaketh thoughtlessly is certain to fail in attainment; who

The wise man considereth even

easy things hard, so that even hard things are easy to him.

  

64

ATTENDING TO DETAILS

  

It is easy to grasp what is not yet in motion, to withstand what is not

yet manifest, to break what is not yet compact, to disperse what is not

Act against things before they become visible; attend to

order before disorder ariseth.

  

The tree which filleth the embrace grew from a small shoot; the tower

nine-storied rose from a low foundation; the ten-day journey began with a

single step.

  

The wise

man acteth not, so worketh no harm; he doth not grasp, and so doth not

Men often ruin their affairs on the eve of success, because they

are not as prudent at the end as in the beginning.

  

The wise man willeth what others do not will, and valueth not things

He learneth what others learn not, and gathered up what they despise.

Thus he is in accord with the natural course of events, and is not overbold

in action.

  

65

THE PURITY OF THE TEH

  

They of old time that were skilled in the Tao sought not to enlighten the

people, but to keep them simple.

  

To use

cleverness in government is to scourge the kingdom; to use simplicity is

to anoint it.

  

To possess

Profound and Extended is this

Perfection; he that possesseth it is indeed contrary to the rest, but he

attracteth them to full accordance.

  

66

PUTTING ONE'S SELF LAST

  

The oceans and the rivers attract the streams by their skill in being

So the Wise Man, to be

above men, speaketh lowly; and to precede them acteth with humility.

  

Thus, though he be above them, they feel no burden; nor, though he

precede them, do they feel insulted.

  

He

contendeth not against any man; therefore no man is able to contend

against him.

  

67

THE THREE JEWELS

  

This

If it were like anything else, its

smallness would have long been known.

  

I have three jewels of price whereto I cleave; gentleness, economy ,and

humility.

  

That gentleness maketh me courageous, that economy generous, that

Men of today abandon gentleness for violence, economy

for extravagance, humility for pride: this is death.

  

Gentleness bringeth victory in fight; and holdeth its ground with

Heaven wardeth the gentle man by that same virtue.

  

68

ASSIMILATING ONE'S SELF TO HEAVEN

  

He that is skilled in war maketh no fierce gestures; the most efficient

He who conquereth refraineth from engaging in

battle; he whom men most willingly obey continueth silently with his

So it is said: 'He is mighty who fighteth not; he ruleth who

uniteth with his subjects; he shineth whose will is that of Heaven.'

  

69

THE USE OF THE MYSTERIOUS WAY

  

I prefer the

I dare not advance an inch; I prefer to retreat a foot.'

Place therefore the army where there is no army; prepare for action where

there is no engagement; strike where there is no conflict; advance

against the enemy where the enemy is not.

  

There is no error so great as to engage in battle without sufficient

To do so is to risk losing the gentleness which is beyond price.

Thus when the lines actually engage, he who regretteth the necessity is

the victor.

  

70

THE DIFFICULTY OF RIGHT APPREHENSION

  

My words are easy to understand and to perform; but is there anyone in

the world who can understand them and perform them?

  

My words derive from a creative and universal Principle, in accord with

Men, not knowing these, understand me not.

  

Few are they that understand me; therefore am I the more to be valued.

The Wise Man weareth sack-cloth, but guardeth his jewel in his bosom.

  

71

THE DISTEMPER OF KNOWLEDGE

  

To know, yet to know nothing, is the highest; not to know, yet to pretend

to knowledge, is a distemper.

  

The wise man hath it

Knowing it to be bound up with Sorrow, he putteth it away from him.

  

72

CONCERNING LOVE OF SELF

  

When men fear not that which is to be feared, that which they fear cometh

on them.

  

Let them not live, without thought, the superficial life.

Let them not weary of the Spring of Life!

  

By avoiding the superficial life, this weariness cometh not upon them.

  

These things the wise man knoweth, not showeth: he loveth himself,

He accepteth the former and rejecteth

the latter.

  

73

ESTABLISHING THE LAW OF FREEDOM

  

It would seem

Yet when

Therefore the

sage is diffident.

  

The Tao of Heaven contendeth not, yet it overcometh; it is silent, yet

its need is answered; it summoneth none, but all men come to it of their

Large

are the meshes of Heaven's Net; wide open, yet letting none escape.

  

74

A RESTRAINT OF MISUNDERSTANDING

  

The people have no fear of death; why then seek to awe them by the threat

If the people feared death and I could put to death evil-doers,

who would dare to offend?

  

He who would usurp that position

Such an one,

presumptuous, will be sure to cut his own hands.

  

75

THE INJURY OF GREED

  

In such a state of insecurity it is better to ignore the question of living

than to set store by it.

  

76

A WARNING AGAINST RIGIDITY

  

At the birth of man, he is elastic and weak; at his death, rigid and

This is the common law; trees also, in their youth, are

tender and supple; in their decay, hard and dry.

  

So then rigidity and hardness are the stigmata of death; elasticity and

adaptability, of life.

  

He then who putteth forth strength is not victorious; even as a strong

tree filleth the embrace.

  

Thus the hard and rigid have the inferior place, the soft and elastic the

superior.

  

77

THE WAY OF HEAVEN

  

The Tao of Heaven is likened to the bending of a bow, whereby the high

The extreme is

diminished, and the middle increased.

  

This is the Way of Heaven, to remove excess, and to supplement

Not so is the way of man, who taketh away from him that

hath not to give to him that hath already excess.

  

Only he

that possesseth the Tao.

  

So the Wise Man acteth without lust of result; achieveth and boasteth

not; he willeth not to proclaim his greatness.

  

78

A CREED

  

Nothing in the world is more elastic and yielding than water; yet it is

preeminent to dissolve things rigid and resistant; there is nothing which

can match it.

  

All men know that the soft overcometh the hard, and the weak conquereth

the strong; but none are able to use this law in action.

  

A Wise Man hath said: 'He that taketh on the burden of the state is a

demigod worthy of sacrificial worship; and the true King of a people is

he that undertaketh the weight of their sorrows.'

  

Truth appeareth paradox.

  

79

TRUTH IN COVENANT

  

When enemies are reconciled, there is always an aftermath of ill will.

How can this be useful?

  

Therefore, the Wise Man, while he keepeth his part of the record of a

He who hath the

Teh considereth the situation from all sides, while he who hath it not

seeketh only to benefit himself.

  

In the Tao of Heaven, there is no distinction of persons in its love; but

it is for the True Man to claim it.

  

80

ISOLATION

  

In a little kingdom of few people it should be the order that though

there were men able to do the work of ten men or five score, they should

Though the people regarded death as sorrowful, yet they

should not wish to go elsewhere.

  

They should have boats and wagons, yet no necessity to travel; corslets

and weapons, yet no occasion to fight.

  

For communication they should use knotted cords.

  

They should deem their food sweet, their clothes beautiful, their houses

homes, their customs delightful.

  

There should be another state within view, so that its fowls and dogs

should be heard; yet to old age, even to death, the people should hold no

traffic with it.

  

81

THE SHEWING-FORTH OF SIMPLICITY

  

Those who

Those who

have assimilated are not learned; those who are gross with learning have

not assimilated.

  

The more he giveth, the more he hath; the

more he watereth, the more is he watered himself.

  

The Tao of Heaven is like an Arrow, yet it woundeth not; and the Wise

Man, in all his Works, maketh no contention.
